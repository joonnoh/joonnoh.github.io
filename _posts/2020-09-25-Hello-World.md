title: Here's what I've been up to...
---

You're me and just became unemployed because of a crazy pandemic. What do you do?

I'll tell you what I did:

**1. Think About Long Term**

  First thing I thought about was where I wanted to end up. It may seem backwards to think about the end before figuring out the beginning, but I find that reverse-engineering your goals can help with the planning process. I had a good idea of where I want to live, the people I'm happiest around, and what I want to accomplish in life. With those in mind, combined with what I believe I'm capable of, I knew working in the tech industry was my calling. I've tried different career paths but I always seem to come back to IT. I felt like I was behind compared to my peers but accepted that everyone's journey is different.

> Lesson learned: Comparison is the thief of joy.

**2. Healthy Mind and Body**

  After neglecting my health for several years, I set a plan in motion to improve myself. If there's one thing I can change that no one else can, it is my own thoughts and actions. I've felt like I hit rock bottom several times and struggled to pick myself up and keep going. I accepted my flaws and failures and changed how I perceived the world. It took time and effort to develop a positive attitude and forward thinking mindset, but it's worth it as I'm calmer and more balanced.
  
  I started with walking every day and it eventually progressed to buying a set of adjustable dumbbells to work out at home. Then I made a plan to build more muscle, consume less calories, and eat a well-rounded diet. Of course I still ate the occasional pizza and fried chicken but less frequently. Then I started running using the Couch to 5K app. As of writing, I've lost about 15 pounds and I'm still working towards my target weight! It's a combination of mental fortitude and consistent physical activity that have helped me progress this far.

> Lesson learned: Don't rely solely on motivation. Discipline yourself to do the hard things so that motivation won't be the deciding factor when you feel lazy or discouraged.

**3. Improving My Skills and Knowledge**

  Now for the fun part: how can I best prepare for my next IT job? IT is HUGE and there are so many things to learn. I narrowed the topics down to help me focus on what was relevant to the career I was working towards. Infosec always seems to have interesting problems to solve and after researching more about cloud services, I decided to make it a goal to become a cloud engineer. I spent hours reading through other peoples' experiences on Google and Reddit and found the general topics to be: computer networking, information security, Linux, scripting, and cloud. I decided to do a lot of research into each topic, study from various resources while applying the concepts, and validate the knowledge I gained by earning industry certifications.
  
  I started learning about networking in order to prepare for the CompTIA Network+ CE certification. I knew I wouldn't learn everything about how networks are set up and managed but I got a solid understand of the basics such as IP address, subnet, gateway, DNS, DHCP, and tons of other terminology (who would've thought that the acronym for Wireless Access Point would mean something totally different now). I really enjoyed studying for this exam because we often see these things come up in our personal lives and not just work. Professor Messer is a great resource to use!
  
  Once I passed the Network+, I went straight for the Security+. There were a variety of concepts to grasp such as types of malware, risk management, and cryptography. During a previous job, I installed a Hardware Security Module (HSM) and used encryption keys often to securely transfer files with colleagues and customers. I understood how security is applied to systems and how important it is for organizations and users to take it seriously. Professor Messer was a big help here again as well as Darril Gibson's Get Certified Get Ahead study guide.
  
  Around this time, I attended DefCon 2020 virtually by joining the Discord server and watching Twitch streams. I'm glad they hosted it online this year and made it free for everyone so I got a chance to see what it's all about. There were a ton of events and speakers who dove into topics such as penetration testing and election hacking. I'm hoping to attend the event in Las Vegas in the future!
  
  At this point, I wanted solid knowledge and experience using the Linux operating system. I saw many people suggesting the Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA) as a great entry level Linux certification. This was definitely the most challenging and time consuming of the bunch but well worth it. Since it's a practical exam, there is hardly any guessing involved. But because I spent day after day using RHEL8 virtual machines and practicing the objectives, I passed the exam! I highly recommend this material for anyone looking to a structured way of learning Linux administration. It's a different kind of feeling when you can edit files, set up repositories and install software, manage users and groups, and perform many more tasks using only the command line. I used Asghar Ghori's preparation guide as my main resource and supplemented with Sander van Vugt and YouTube videos.

  The last certification I earned was Amazon Web Services Certified Cloud Practitioner. I learned about the many AWS services and how the most popular ones are used. It's impressive how Amazon has created a global infrastructure to deliver their product and I'm excited to learn more about the technical aspects of their cloud services. I found video courses on Udemy by Stephane Maarek and a set of 6 practice exams to be super helpful.
  
  Afterwards, I set up an environment to learn Python and practiced writing scripts. I have a good understanding of the basics of programming and developed an application in C# at my previous job. Using Python and Bash to automate tasks is something I'm continually improving on. I'm reading Automate the Boring Stuff and completed a crash course on Python from Google instructors on Coursera. I've also been following the subreddit linuxupskillchallenge where I use AWS EC2 instance for an Ubuntu server and administer tasks. I'm currently working on the Cloud Resume Challenge which you can find at [injoonuity.com](https://injoonuity.com)
  
  > Lesson learned: Don't earn certifications for the sake of it. Try to learn the material and apply it in projects and daily use.
